Edge detection is the process of finding all the edges in an image and making them sharper.
Edge detection can be used to make the edges of an image pop out more to make the image better.
There are 4 methods of edge detection. Method 1 is to take the slopes of the surrounding pixels. Method two is to take the slopes of all 8 surrounding pixels from the middle. Method 3 is to just take the vertical and horizontal slopes from the middle. 
Method 1 and 3 are the best for cartesian patterns since they are straight lines and cartesian patterns mostly have straight lines. 
Method 2 and 3 are the best for radial patterns since they take all the slopes from the middle which is good for a circular pattern.
